# Description

The `out/production/Desktop` directory houses the compiled bytecode files (`.class`) resulting from the compilation of Java source code. These compiled files are ready for execution in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Note

- **Modification**: It's recommended not to directly modify these compiled class files. Make changes to the source code instead and recompile.
- **Version Control**: Typically, compiled files are not stored in version control systems; it's preferred to keep only the source code in version control.

Always ensure that these compiled files are generated from the latest version of your source code to maintain consistency and accuracy.
