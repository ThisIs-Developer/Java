# Alternate Factorial Series Calculation [- View Code](https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Java/blob/main/Basic%20Code/Math%20-%20series/AlternateFactorialSeries.java)

This Java program computes the sum of an alternate factorial series based on the given inputs `n` and `x`.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input two numbers: 
- `n`: The number of terms in the series
- `x`: The value used in calculations

It then calculates the sum of the series based on the formula:
x - x/2! + x/3! - x/4! ... +- x/n!

The series alternates between addition and subtraction based on the position of the term (even or odd).

# Combination Calculation [- View Code](https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Java/blob/main/Basic%20Code/Math%20-%20series/CombinationCalculation.java)

This Java program calculates the combination (n choose r) using the formula n! / ((n-r)! * r!).

## Description

The program prompts the user to input two integers:
- `n`: The total number of items.
- `r`: The number of items to choose.

It then computes the combination using the provided formula:
n! / ((n-r)! * r!)

# Positive Series Sum Calculation [- View Code](https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Java/blob/main/Basic%20Code/Math%20-%20series/PositiveSeriesSum.java)

This Java program calculates the sum of a series given by 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input an integer:
- `n`: The number of terms in the series.

It then computes the sum of the series based on the formula:
1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!
